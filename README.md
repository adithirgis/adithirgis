### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I am a Geospatial Analyst at [ILK Labs](https://www.ilklabs.com/) Bangalore, India. I love automating things and making a code simple to use. Developer and maintainer of [`mmaqshiny`](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/mmaqshiny/index.html). I would glad to hear suggestions and feedback for this (mmaqshiny) [package](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.02250). I am also a co-organiser of [R-Ladies Bangalore](https://twitter.com/RLadiesBLR).

I love #rstats, #python, #environment, slides with emojis and I beleive in converting(SpatialData_To_Information). I am a huge fan of [Rcpp](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/index.html) and of course [rayshader.](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rayshader/index.html)
