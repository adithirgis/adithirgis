### Hi there! 👋🏽

I am a Geospatial Analyst at [ILK Labs](https://www.ilklabs.com/) Bangalore, India. I love automating things and making a code, simple to use. Developer and maintainer of [`mmaqshiny`](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/mmaqshiny/index.html). I would be glad to hear suggestions or feedback for this (mmaqshiny) [package](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.02250). I am also a co-founder and co-organiser of [R-Ladies Bangalore](https://twitter.com/RLadiesBLR) and a peer [reviewer](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/reviewed_by/@adithirgis) for the Journal of Open Source Software. Looking forward to see some of you during useR! 2021!

Current project - Open Source Air quality data (India) application.

I love #rstats, #python, #environment, slides with emojis, #wildlife, burgers, slender lorises and I believe in converting(SpatialData_To_Information). I am a huge fan of [Rcpp](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/index.html) and of course [rayshader.](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rayshader/index.html)
