### Hi there! 👋🏽 I am a 👩🏽‍💻

Thanks for stopping by. 

I am a Geospatial Analyst at [ILK Labs](https://www.ilklabs.com/) Bangalore, India. I love automating things and making a code, simple to use. Creator and maintainer of [`mmaqshiny`](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/mmaqshiny/index.html) and [`pollucheck`](https://github.com/adithirgis/pollucheck). I would be glad to hear suggestions or feedback for these packages. I am also a co-founder and co-organiser of [R-Ladies Bangalore](https://twitter.com/RLadiesBLR) and a peer [reviewer](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/reviewed_by/@adithirgis) for the Journal of Open Source Software and rOpenSci. I was a part of Global organizing committee  for the [useR! 2021](https://user2021.r-project.org/about/global-team/). I volunteer for [Bangpypers](https://bangalore.pythonindia.org/), when not working for R communities. 
Along with all this I was a GIS consultant for Asian Nature Conservation Foundation to create Elephant Atlas for the state of Karnataka. 

Current project - Mobile Monitoring of Air Quality in Bangalore, India and applying different predictive models to low-cost air quality sensor data.

Open Source - I have started maintaining [ropenaq](https://github.com/ropensci/ropenaq). 

As part of R Ladies Asia we proposed an incubator at useR! 2021 about Strategies to build a strong AsiaR community where we have featured users from Asia. Please contact me if you want to join us on this jouRney!
