### Hi there! 👋🏽 I am a 👩🏽‍💻

Thanks for stopping by. 

I am a Geospatial Analyst at [ILK Labs](https://www.ilklabs.com/) Bangalore, India. I love automating things and making a code, simple to use.

I am a certified [RStudio tidyverse instructor](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/people/upadhya+adithi/). I am also a co-founder and co-organiser of [R-Ladies Bangalore](https://twitter.com/RLadiesBLR) and a peer reviewer for the [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/reviewed_by/@adithirgis) and [rOpenSci](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/418#issuecomment-995521139).
