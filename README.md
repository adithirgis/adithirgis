### Hi there! 👋🏽 I am a 👩🏽‍💻

I am a Geospatial Analyst at [ILK Labs](https://www.ilklabs.com/) Bangalore, India. I love automating things and making a code, simple to use. Developer and maintainer of [`mmaqshiny`](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/mmaqshiny/index.html) and [`pollucheck`](https://github.com/adithirgis/pollucheck). I would be glad to hear suggestions or feedback for these packages. I am also a co-founder and co-organiser of [R-Ladies Bangalore](https://twitter.com/RLadiesBLR) and a peer [reviewer](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/reviewed_by/@adithirgis) for the Journal of Open Source Software. I am a part of Global organizing committee  for the [useR! 2021](https://user2021.r-project.org/about/global-team/), in which I contributed to finding sponsors, assisting program, content team and was also the member of Code of Conduct response team. I am also a volunteer for [Bangpypers](https://bangalore.pythonindia.org/), Bangalore python users group. Along with all this I was a GIS consultant for Asian Nature Conservation Foundation. 

Current project - Mobile Monitoring of Air Quality in Bangalore, India. 
Open Source - I have started maintaining [ropenaq](https://github.com/ropensci/ropenaq). 

As part of R Ladies Asia we are proposing an incubator at useR! 2021 about Strategies to build a strong AsiaR community where we have featured useR! from Asia. Please participate to show your support and spread the word! 

I love #rstats, #python, #environment, slides with emojis, #wildlife, burgers, slender lorises and I believe in converting(SpatialData_To_Information). I am a huge fan of [Rcpp](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/index.html) and of course [rayshader.](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rayshader/index.html)
