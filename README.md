### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I am a Geospatial Analyst at [ILK Labs](https://www.ilklabs.com/) Bangalore, India. I love automating things and making a code, simple to use. Developer and maintainer of [`mmaqshiny`](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/mmaqshiny/index.html). I would be glad to hear suggestions or feedback for this (mmaqshiny) [package](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.02250). I am also a co-organiser of [R-Ladies Bangalore](https://twitter.com/RLadiesBLR) and a peer [reviewer](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/reviewed_by/@adithirgis) for the Journal of Open Source Software.

I love #rstats, #python, #environment, slides with emojis, #wildlife, burgers, slender lorises and I believe in converting(SpatialData_To_Information). I am a huge fan of [Rcpp](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/index.html) and of course [rayshader.](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rayshader/index.html)

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Mobile Monitoring of Air Quality in Bangalore.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m constantly learning to automate and code effectively.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [@AdithiUpadhya](https://twitter.com/AdithiUpadhya) on twitter, or here.
