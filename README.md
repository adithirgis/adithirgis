### Hi there! 👋🏽 I am a 👩🏽‍💻

Thanks for stopping by. 

I am a Geospatial and Data Science consultant based in Leeds, UK. Currently I am a Research Assistant at the University of Liverpool. I love automating things and making a code, simple to use. I am the developer and maintainer of [`mmaqshiny`](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/mmaqshiny/index.html) and [`pollucheck`](https://github.com/adithirgis/pollucheck) which is open source and are shiny apps for analysing and visualising air quality data (data from specific instruments and open source air quality data available in India). I am a certified [Tidyverse instructor](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/people/upadhya+adithi/) and am interested in teaching R to professionals and researchers. I am a peer reviewer for the [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/reviewed_by/@adithirgis) and [rOpenSci](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/418#issuecomment-995521139). I was a part of Global organizing committee  for the [useR! 2021](https://user2021.r-project.org/about/global-team/). 

I co-founded [R-Ladies Bangalore](https://twitter.com/RLadiesBLR) and [AsiaR](https://github.com/AsiaR-community). Along with all this I was a volunteer consultant for Asian Nature Conservation Foundation where I contributed in creating an Elephant Atlas for the state of Karnataka.
