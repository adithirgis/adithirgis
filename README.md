### 👋 Hi there, I'm Adithi Upadhya!
Geospatial & Data Science Consultant | R Developer | Environmental Data Enthusiast

I'm currently based in Bengaluru, India, working remotely with the University of Liverpool. My work revolves around using data to tell meaningful stories about the environment—especially air quality and public health. I thrive on simplifying complex workflows and automating repetitive tasks, all while keeping code clean, reusable, and user-friendly.

I built [mmaqshiny](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/mmaqshiny/index.html) and [pollucheck](https://github.com/adithirgis/pollucheck), open-source R Shiny apps designed for analyzing and visualizing air quality data from both official instruments and open data sources in India. I'm also a certified [Tidyverse instructor](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/people/upadhya+adithi/), and actively contribute as a peer reviewer for the [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/reviewed_by/@adithirgis) and [rOpenSci](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/418#issuecomment-995521139).

As a community builder, I co-founded [AsiaR](https://github.com/AsiaR-community) and  [R-Ladies Bangalore](https://x.com/RLadiesBLR), and was part of the global organizing team for [useR! 2021](https://user2021.r-project.org/about/global-team/). I’ve also volunteered as a consultant with the Asian Nature Conservation Foundation—combining my passion for tech with my love for wildlife.
